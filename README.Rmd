# surveyGEER

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Bring the remotely sense data straight into your survey data set

## Installation

You can install the development version of surveyGEER like so:

``` r
devtools::    
```

This package will hold templates and data-pipelines to extract remote sensing data using the `rgee` and new `tidyrgee` packages. Templates will be stored as vignettes in the package. I will provide one template in this readme to serve as an example


## Hex Maps

This template will show you how to extract the data to make maps similar to these hexagon maps below

**NDVI Standard Score Map**
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/202203_som_ndvi.png")
```

**Precipitaiton Record Low Map**
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/20220420_som_record_low_rainfall_2021.png")
```

Well below is the code to extract the data relevant to your context. Once the data is extracted it can easily be mapped in any GIS software (even here in R). If you like how the above examples look, feel free to email zack.arno.ext@impact-initiatives.org for the QGIS templates

```{r example}
library(surveyGEER)
library(rgee)
library(tidyrgee)

# ee_Initialize()

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:
